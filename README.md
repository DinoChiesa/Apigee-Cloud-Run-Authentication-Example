# Connect into a Cloud Run Service from an Apigee Proxy

This sample demonstrates various ways to connect into a Cloud Run Service from
an Apigee Proxy. In all cases the Cloud Run service requires Authentication.

The proxy uses these approaches:

- passthrough - the caller must pass an Authorization header, which is relayed
  to the upstream Cloud Run service.

- platform authentication - the proxy uses Apigee to automatically obtain an
  Identity token for use with the upstream Cloud Run service.

- "impersonation" authentication - the proxy calls into the IAM credentials endpoint to
  "manually" obtain an Identity token for use with the upstream Cloud Run
  service.

- "indirect" authentication - the proxy calls into Secret Manager to retrieve a
  key file for a 2nd service account, and then uses _that key_ to obtain an
  Identity token for use with the upstream Cloud Run service.

## Using the Sample

### Prerequisites

You need these things:

  * bash
  * the [gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  * unzip, curl, jq, sed, mktemp

You can get all of this in [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell).

### On Projects and Permissions

You can have the Cloud Run service running in a different project than your Apigee API proxy.

To make this all work, it's easiest if  you are "Owner" or "Editor" in the various projects.
I haven't determined exactly which permissions you require.

You will need the permission to perform these actions:

- importing and deploying Apigee proxies
- deploying Cloud Run using Cloud Build (import from source)
- creating service accounts
- updating IAM policy on Cloud Run services
- creating and downloading service account keys


## Setup steps

To prepare:

1. edit the env.sh file and provide your settings. Then, source the modified file:
   ```sh
   source ./env.sh
   ```

2. deploy the Cloud Run service.
   ```sh
   ./1-deploy-cloud-run-service.sh
   ```

3. create a service account in the Apigee project
   ```sh
   ./2-create-service-account-in-apigee-local-project.sh
   ```

3. create a service account in the Cloud Run project
   ```sh
   ./3-create-service-account-in-cloudrun-remote-project.sh
   ```

4. Create and download the service account key file.
   ```sh
   ./4-create-and-download-service-account-keyfile.sh
   ```

5. Upload the service account key file to Secret Manager
   ```sh
   ./5-upload-service-account-key-to-secret-manager.sh
   ```

5. Grant permission to invoke the cloud run service, to the two service accounts
   ```sh
   ./6-grant_access-to-cloud-run-service-to-sa.sh ${SA_FOR_APIGEE_PROXY} ${APIGEE_PROJECT_ID}
   ./6-grant_access-to-cloud-run-service-to-sa.sh ${SA_IN_CLOUDRUN_PROJECT} ${CLOUDRUN_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

5. install apigeecli
   ```sh
   ./7-install-apigeecli.sh
   ```

5. Update the Apigee proxy with the URL for the Cloud Run Service, and the metadata (name and version) for the Secret.
   ```sh
   ./8-update-proxy-with-cloud-run-url.sh
   ```

5. Import and deploy the API proxy.
   ```sh
   ./9-import-and-deploy-apigee-proxy.sh
   ```

## Invoking the API proxy

1. Use passthrough authentication.

   Here, you obtain your own ID Token, and send it into the Apigee API proxy.
   The proxy relays that token to the upstream Cloud Run service. If you
   have run.invoker permissions on the Cloud Run service, you will see a happy message.

   ```sh
   IDTOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)
   curl -i -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $IDTOKEN"  -H "auth-type: passthrough" \
       https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/cloudrun-authenticated-sample/status
   ```

   In the output, you should a json payload. The email of the caller should be _your email_.


2. Use Platform authentication.

   In this case, Apigee obtains an ID Token, on behalf of its Service Account
   identity. Apigee sends that ID Token to the upstream Cloud Run service. The
   Service account has `run.invoker` role on the Cloud Run service, so you
   will see a happy message.

   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET -H "auth-type: platform" https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/cloudrun-authenticated-sample/status
   ```

   In the output, the json payload should show the email address and subject ID
   of the Apigee service account.

3. Use "Impersonation"

   In this case, the Apigee proxy is configured to manually request an ID Token,
   on behalf of a configured Service Account identity, from the Google Cloud IAM
   endpoint. The SA that the  Apigee proxy is running as, must have `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`
   role on the Service Account that it requests an Identity Token for.  (This is true even
   if the Service Account requested is the same identity as the caller!, ie if
   a Service Account is requesting an Identity Token for itself.)

   This works like the previous case, but your API Proxy logic is obtaining the
   ID token "manually" with a network call, and in this case, does not cache it
   (though you could add to the proxy logic, to do so).

   The "impersonated" Service account must have `run.invoker` role on the Cloud
   Run service, in order for this to work. In that case, you will see a happy
   message.

   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET -H "auth-type: impersonated" https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/cloudrun-authenticated-sample/status
   ```

   In the output, the json payload should show the email and subject ID of the
   impersonated service account, which may be the same as the above.

1. Use "Indirect" authentication.

   In this case, the Apigee proxy, running with the identity of a service
   account is configured to retrieve credentials for a _separate_ service
   account, from the Secret Manager. The proxy then uses the private key
   retrieved from Secret Manager to construct an assertion and sends that
   assertion in a request to the oauth2.googleapis.com, to manually request an
   ID Token, on behalf of the Service Account identity corresponding to the
   retrieved credentials. Apigee sends that ID Token to the upstream Cloud Run
   service.

   If the 2nd Service account has `run.invoker` role on the Cloud Run service,
   the request will succeed, and you will see a happy message.

   ```sh
   curl -i -X GET -H "auth-type: indirect" https://${APIGEE_HOST}/v1/samples/cloudrun-authenticated-sample/status
   ```

   In the output, the json payload should show the email and subject ID of the
   second (possibly remote) service account.

## Cleanup

Run the cleanup script to remove all the assets:
```sh
